## Why this Matters for Everyone

Stablecoins are a breakthrough in digital finance, modernizing payments, reducing transaction costs, and making financial services more efficient and inclusive—especially for consumers and small businesses underserved by traditional systems.

![Person holding a smartphone displaying Solana blockchain logo in a dimly lit room.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68cabfe8e86df863709e37cb_Rectangle%2037.webp)

Why this Matters

##### For Consumers

Payments shouldn’t be slow or expensive. With faster, cheaper transactions available 24/7, consumers gain the freedom to send and receive money instantly, no matter where they are in the world. This global reach increases convenience, reduces costs, and creates new opportunities for participation in the digital economy.

Why this Matters

##### For Small Businesses

Small businesses thrive when payments are simple and affordable. Lower processing fees and real-time settlement mean business owners can reduce overhead, improve cash flow, and focus on growth instead of financial friction. This helps entrepreneurs compete more effectively in both local and international markets.

Why this Matters

##### For Builders

Innovation needs clarity to flourish. By providing clear rules of the road, developers and entrepreneurs can experiment, invest, and scale with confidence. Builders gain a stable environment to test new financial tools, applications, and services—accelerating progress and opening doors to entirely new markets.

Why this Matters

##### For the Economy

A stronger financial system benefits everyone. By reinforcing the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency, demand for U.S. Treasuries increases, strengthening economic stability. This supports long-term growth, attracts global investment, and ensures the financial system remains resilient in a rapidly changing world.

## Tax Clarity for Staking
[![social icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68d59004c5843e891f8cc67b_solana-logo-white.svg)![social icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68d59004966aeef8d89fa944_solana-logo-colorful.svg)](https://www.solanapolicyinstitute.org/)

### A Modern Framework for a Modern Technology

Staking and mining are foundational components of secure proof-of-stake networks like Solana. But federal tax treatment of staking and mining rewards has lagged behind the technology. Newly created tokens like mining and staking rewards should be taxed the same way all other newly created property is taxed—only when sold.

### What’s at Risk

IRS guidance issued in 2023 treats newly created tokens as immediate income—an approach that is inconsistent with longstanding principles of U.S. tax law and is administratively burdensome.

A modernized tax framework should treat newly created tokens in the same way other newly created property is treated and tax them only when they are disposed of. Updated guidance should apply longstanding character and sourcing rules to any gain realized at sale, maintain neutrality across all digital asset consensus mechanisms, and reduce compliance burdens while providing greater certainty for developers and validators.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/692deac68f9a908bf69cb2da_Frame%201171279230%20(1).png)

## Why this Matters

Fair and consistent tax treatment will help transform digital assets from unfairly disadvantaged assets into legitimate portfolio components.

[These Tokens Aren’t Income at Creation](https://www.solanapolicyinstitute.org/tax-clarity-for-staking-and-mining#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-0) [The Phantom Income Problem](https://www.solanapolicyinstitute.org/tax-clarity-for-staking-and-mining#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-1) [American Crypto Leadership](https://www.solanapolicyinstitute.org/tax-clarity-for-staking-and-mining#w-tabs-0-data-w-pane-2)

Why this Matters

##### These Tokens Aren’t Income at Creation

In proof-of-stake systems, validators independently create new blocks, which generates new tokens. These tokens are not received from someone else and do not represent a transfer of wealth. Under a consistent, realization-based tax framework, mining and staking rewards become taxable only when disposed of, and the gain or loss is measured at that time.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/692d8ec80bea803481d7b489_Rectangle%2037%20(18).png)

Why this Matters

##### The Phantom Income Problem

Under the IRS’s 2023 interpretation, newly created tokens are taxed as if they were income, even when no gain has been realized and no transfer has occurred. This creates non-existent or “phantom” income, forcing millions of Americans into taxable events that are not gains under any standard economic definition.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/692d8f24357304a95e36541c_Rectangle%2037%20(19).png)

Why this Matters

##### American Crypto Leadership

Staking and mining secures the networks underpinning the next generation of financial infrastructure, and the U.S. should capture the economic value this innovation creates—not let it shift overseas. Clear, modern staking tax rules would strengthen domestic validator activity, attract investment, and keep the growth of the digital asset economy anchored in America.

### A Sensible, Neutral Approach

Solana Policy Institute is calling on the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service to update federal tax guidance for digital asset staking and mining. Clear rules should recognize newly created tokens as created property that is taxed only when sold, not when generated. Any gain at the time of sale should be classified according to the same long-standing tax principles that apply to other forms of property.

Congress should enact legislation codifying this approach by passing legislation to treat newly created tokens as newly created property and tax them only upon sale. Such legislation would eliminate ambiguity, protect taxpayers, and ensure that decentralized network participation is not punished under misguided law. This approach aligns mining and staking taxation with how the tax code already treats every other category of self-created property.

### Instantaneous Settlement

Trades settle immediately wallet-to-wallet, eliminating traditional multi-day settlement periods and counterparty risk

## Why this Matters for Everyone

This is an effort towards unlocking billions or more in traditional assets (stocks, bonds, funds) to trade 24/7 with instant settlement, lower costs, and unprecedented transparency—while keeping the US competitive in financial innovation.

Why this Matters

Why this Matters

##### Enhancing Market Efficiency

Settlement times that once took days can now be reduced to mere seconds. Faster transactions lower operational costs, minimize systemic risks, and increase liquidity—delivering a more efficient and resilient financial marketplace.

![Person sitting at a round table using two laptops displaying financial charts and data.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68cb1de997b975cf45b8fc02_Rectangle%2037%20(6).webp)

Why this Matters

##### Improving Transparency

Blockchain’s built-in transparency provides regulators and market participants with clearer, real-time visibility into financial activity. This reduces hidden risks, builds confidence in the system, and enhances accountability across the market.

Why this Matters

##### Broadening Market Access

By lowering frictional costs and removing traditional barriers, blockchain opens new opportunities for more Americans to engage in capital markets. Broader access means greater participation, inclusion, and financial empowerment.

Why this Matters

##### Eliminating Settlement Risk

Delays between trade execution and settlement expose participants to risk. With blockchain-enabled systems, settlement happens instantly, eliminating gaps and ensuring greater security and trust in every transaction.

![Person in a suit holding and using a smartphone in a blurred office corridor.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68cb1e8bad1328012f45d866_Rectangle%2037%20(9).webp)

Why this Matters

##### Streamlining Systems

Digital tokens enable seamless movement of value across the financial system. By connecting previously siloed processes, blockchain reduces complexity, enhances speed, and lays the foundation for a more modern, interconnected infrastructure.

## Developer Protections Overview
[![social icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68d59004c5843e891f8cc67b_solana-logo-white.svg)![social icon](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68d59004966aeef8d89fa944_solana-logo-colorful.svg)](https://www.solanapolicyinstitute.org/)

### Protect the Builders of our Financial Future

The next generation of U.S. financial infrastructure is open-source and blockchain-based—created by developers building transparent systems that empower consumer choice. As Congress crafts digital asset legislation, we must ensure lasting protections for open-source software developers.

### What’s at Risk

![White silhouette of a human head with a code symbol inside, representing coding or programming knowledge.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68c465d0cea2022ef5ba7e6c_Frame%20(1).png)

### Since 2015, U.S. share of developers has declined

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e551772d05fa5df91bce56/68c465b338ab0d715e2146fe_Frame%20(9).svg)

### 50%

America’s share of global open-source developers has fallen by more than half, weakening our competitive edge in financial innovation.

### Why this Matters

Open-source builders and service providers are at the heart of U.S. financial innovation. Protecting them means protecting America’s role as the "crypto capital of the world."

## Democratizing Investment Access

### SPI Supports the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act

In July 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bipartisan Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, which modernizes the definition of an accredited investor to include knowledge-based qualifications. The bill is with the Senate for consideration.

### What’s at Stake

The current system, which largely restricts private investment opportunities based on an income threshold or net worth, is arbitrary, discriminatory, and economically counterproductive. These outdated criteria exclude investors who possess the knowledge and expertise to evaluate complex investment opportunities but may not meet arbitrary and antiquated wealth requirements.

### 87%

**of Americans are excluded** from private market investments based on the current definition of accredited investors.

### Why this Matters

Expanding access to investment opportunities through knowledge-based criteria would open new avenues for wealth creation and building that aren't dependent on existing wealth.

Instead of asking investors how much money they have, the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act asks whether they understand investment opportunities and their risks. That's a fundamental improvement in fairness and economic opportunity.

Why this Matters

##### Merit Over Money

Qualifications should be based on understanding of investment risks, not arbitrary income thresholds that exclude otherwise capable investors.

Why this Matters

##### Wealth Creation Access

Opens pathways to wealth building through private market participation for those with expertise but not existing wealth.

Why this Matters

##### Economic Fairness

Removes discriminatory barriers that have historically limited economic opportunity for qualified investors

## Every era has a defining system.

The industrial era was built on steel.

The information era was built on the internet.

The next era is built on Solana.

## The rules of the next era are being written now.

Solana is becoming the infrastructure for global markets. Code, capital, and communities are moving onto a faster, more open financial system. At the same time, policymakers are writing the rules that will govern what gets built and who can access it.

## We have a unique opportunity.

Our inudstry needs thoughtful, enduring regulatory frameworks. This will allow Solana builders to channel their energy toward technological advancement rather than navigating regulatory uncertainty, and empower users with confidence and necessary safeguards as they explore Solana's capabilities.

What We Do

## Move fast. Build things.

Breakthroughs in performance, and UX are changing what’s possible on Solana. But without clear rules, even the best ideas can stall, migrate offshore, or never reach scale.

‍

Solana Policy Institute is a non-partisan, non-profit focused on educating policymakers on how decentralized networks like Solana are the future of the digital economy and why the people building on and using them need legal certainty to flourish.

### 1\. Educating policymakers

We brief key decision-makers on how Solana actually works: performance, security, and real-world use cases. We focus on practical implications for markets, consumers, and innovation so they can make informed choices about the frameworks they design.

### 2\. Equipping builders and investors

We help founders, protocols, and asset managers understand where policy is heading, what it means for their roadmap, and how to engage constructively. From explainers and memos to curated briefings, our goal is to turn uncertainty into clarity.

### 3\. Convening the Solana ecosystem

We bring together developers, investors, operators, and policy experts to stress-test ideas, surface risks early, and align around what long-term success looks like for Solana-based infrastructure.
