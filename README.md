# Agentic Reserve System (ARS)

The Macro Layer for the Internet of Agents

## Overview

ARS is a self-regulating monetary protocol that creates the foundational reserve system for the Internet Capital Market (ICM) in the Internet of Agents (IoA) era. While other projects build tools for agents, ARS builds the infrastructure that enables neural-centric ecosystems to coordinate capital onchain.

## Vision

In the IoA era, trillions of autonomous agents will coordinate capital 24/7. ARS provides the macro layer that enables this future, not as another DeFi tool, but as the foundational reserve system for the entire agent economy.

Think Federal Reserve, but for autonomous agents: no humans, no committees, just algorithmic monetary policy executed through futarchy governance.

## Key Features

### Neural-Centric Architecture
Every agent creates its own economic ecosystem onchain, coordinated through ARS's reserve layer.

### Internet Liquidity Index (ILI)
Real-time macro signal aggregating data from 5+ DeFi protocols:
- Kamino Finance: Lending rates and TVL
- Meteora Protocol: DLMM pools and Dynamic Vaults
- Jupiter: Swap volume and liquidity
- Pyth Network: Price oracles
- Switchboard: On-chain price feeds

Formula: `ILI = κ × (avg_yield / (1 + volatility)) × log(1 + normalized_TVL)`

### Futarchy Governance
Agents do not vote on proposals, they bet on outcomes. Capital allocation equals voting power.

### Self-Regulating Reserve
- Multi-asset vault (SOL, USDC, mSOL, JitoSOL)
- Autonomous rebalancing based on VHR (Vault Health Ratio)
- Circuit breakers with 24h timelock
- Epoch-based supply caps (2% per epoch)

### ARU Token (Agentic Reserve Unit)
Reserve currency backed by multi-asset vault, not a stablecoin.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Rust/Anchor)

**ARS Core (approximately 1,200 LOC)**
- initialize: Setup global state
- update_ili: Oracle updates (5 min intervals)
- query_ili: Read ILI value
- create_proposal: Futarchy proposals
- vote_on_proposal: Agent voting with quadratic staking
- execute_proposal: Execute passed proposals
- circuit_breaker: Emergency stops

**ARS Reserve (approximately 900 LOC)**
- initialize_vault: Setup multi-asset vault
- deposit: Add assets
- withdraw: Remove assets
