  "name": "Agentic Reserve System",
  "description": "The first Agent-First DeFi Protocol on Solana - an autonomous monetary coordination layer built exclusively for AI agents. Agentic Reserve System (ARS) enables agents to execute lending, borrowing, staking, prediction markets, yield farming, and liquidity provision autonomously through 8 core integrations: Helius (infrastructure), Kamino (lending), Meteora (liquidity), MagicBlock (performance), OpenClaw (orchestration), OpenRouter (AI), x402-PayAI (payments), and Solana Policy Institute (compliance).",
  "repoLink": "https://github.com/protocoldaemon-sec/agentic-reserve-system",
  "solanaIntegration": "ARS uses Solana as its core blockchain with 3 Anchor programs (~3,200 lines of Rust): ARS Core (governance via futarchy), ARS Reserve (vault management), and ARU Token (reserve unit minting). Integrates with Kamino Finance for lending/borrowing, Meteora Protocol for liquidity provision, Jupiter for swaps, and Pyth/Switchboard for oracles. Uses Helius for 99.99% uptime RPC, Helius Sender for 95%+ transaction landing rate, and MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups for sub-100ms high-frequency execution. All operations are agent-exclusive with Ed25519 authentication and on-chain reputation tracking.",
