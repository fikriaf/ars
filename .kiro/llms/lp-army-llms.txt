### The Diversification Strategy

How to Turn Volatility into a Fee-Generating Machine on Meteora

### Working Strat

When you see someone’s DLMM results it kinda looks like they just “caught a wave”. But if you dig even a little deeper there’s always a long route behind it. From the old NFT chaos to real strategies, from first shaky steps in DeFi to that moment when the whole puzzle finally clicks. This story shows how all that random experience suddenly forms one strong, confident strategy.

@bukanpamanmu

The market is dipping, and it’s unavoidable that we as LPs on @MeteoraAG are also affected since we provide liquidity in SOL pairs.

Today I’m going to share the strategy I use when my pool goes out of range to the token side.

What should I do? Wait for a miracle?

🧵How I Use Spot LP on @MeteoraAG

Even though my main comfort zone is the Bid-Ask shape, I still use Spot in certain scenarios.
Spot can actually generate much higher returns than Bid-Ask if you deploy it at the right moment.

Here are the situations where I personally choose https://t.co/FM8XBn0cJU

Meteora provides three ways for users to LP through DLMM:

Spot

Bid-Ask

Spot is very similar to traditional CLMM, where liquidity is spread evenly across a specified range, but it allows users to dynamically select https://t.co/8KVDfRkc6s

Here’s my mid-term approach on SOL/USDC during this slow bleed.

Instead of catching knives or guessing bottoms, I bought fear only, each time RSI 4h reached extreme lows.

Every dip = a small 5% allocation of my portfolio. No more.

The goal? Stay liquid, https://t.co/GnzJc6VGyv

Slowcook is steady fee farming on @MeteoraAG. The idea is kinda abstract, sometimes it runs a few hours, sometimes it goes for months.

Important to get this right, the tools I use show the past. No guarantee the token keeps printing the same way.

### Make money on volume spikes with Meteora

This setup lets you add solid % to your working stack on @MeteoraAG literally in minutes.

Youve probably seen it before. A token suddenly shoots up outta nowhere. You scroll X, no clue whats behind the pump. Could be many reasons, but one of the most common is when an influencer buys from his wallet. Those first minutes after that buy give the fattest print.

When you’re LPing a runner, you don’t want random entries.

You want structure + patience.

That’s where the combo BidAsk + VPVR shines 🌊 https://t.co/fWEj43vEFQ

🧵 Why Single-Sided SOL Is the Best RR for DLMM on @MeteoraAG ?

Most beginners entering DLMMs will naturally start with 50/50 positions buying the token and pairing it with an equivalent amount of SOL.

It feels like the obvious move… but it’s also what causes many people to https://t.co/02Wz9OgfSM

Unloading some SOL via DLMM and stacking fees with @MeteoraAG while doing so. Eyeing a re-entry on a big dip (if we get it), or unloading heavier if we push towards Solana’s ATH.

Volume was ramping, PA looked strong, community was hyped.

### Check Score before anything else

Before you LP a token, check its Score.

It takes 5 seconds. Saves your whole stack.

Saw a token with 500k/min in volume. Clean PA, pool looked fresh, fees were juicy. But… Score was trash. No liquidity routes, no stable pairs, nothing but SOL.

🧵How to detect exploitable fresh runners in DLMM @MeteoraAG ?

Milords, today we’ll talk about how I detect tokens to set up tight ranges
or any strategy on fresh runners that just launched, and how to avoid rugs (even though we can’t dodge them all).

### Timing & Momentum - Fast Playbook

LP is a timing game. You need to be positioned for the phase that’s happening now.

DAMM v2 - be early, let it cook, exit on strength

Why early matters: With DAMM v2 you buy the token and supply SOL. Fees decay with time as momentum spreads out. The earlier you’re in before a pump, the more the pool routes through you..

### MEMO \#02 - Respect the bins fee

Above 69 bins, the rules change.

Liquidity positions COULD get taxed harder than your thoughts.

New system, new things to learn:

You set up a clean 150-bin LP, but you forget to check the new liquidity position fee for >69 bins. Boom: position costs more than expected.

Not even if it looks early but safe. Because there’s no such thing.

20步0.2%的池子，现在可以加1400根柱子了。知道着意味着什么吗？
1.一个仓位就可以吃到全部很小的成交和波动。
2.意味着更多人会用20步池子去吃fee，更卷的同时，要求更高
3.过去无脑100步2% 1%的模式将会很难吃到东西了。
要求会更高，也就是必须需要实力和技巧才能更好的参与。

### Successful Token Launch with Alpha Vault

When speaking to builders at conferences, we realized that there are few easy guides regarding on-chain liquidity management for early stage teams. As LPs and on-chain market makers, we see the same mistakes overlooked until they become costly errors.

### How to Play After the PUMP: A Practical DLMM..

In today's hyper-volatile, trend-driven on-chain market, many traders are chasing pumps — only to get dumped on. So, how do you turn that chaos into steady profits after the hype?.

This guide breaks down the DLMM model from Meteora, and shows how LPs are using structured strategies (not just vibes) to survive post-pump volatility — all based on real insights from the UnifAI Chinese community AMA.

每个人都有他熟悉的dlmm方式，每个lper都是市场上的零售商人。
如果你不能意识或承认到你是一个聪明的零售商，你就很难在市场上存活下去。

市场上的零售商的行为都是公开的。如果你胜率不能达到90%以上，我建议就不要继续去卷这个市场。你就不如直接买卖你喜欢的标。专业的事交给专业的人。

Token launches are good opportunity for LPing, but in the pursuit of wealth, you might forget about safety measures. One mistake can lead to a total wipeout.

Prepare for the upcoming $PUMP launch to save yourself from liquidation. https://t.co/u9FUUDcm7J

### My 2 DLMM Strategies: Pros/Psychos

A couple days ago, I cashed out almost $700 in profit in 13mins. Here are the 2 strategies I used and my token discovery process.

1/ My Everyday Strategy

@met\_lparmy has all the alpha. I repeat, join the free discord, you're missing out.

So, I randomly checked LP army discord (degen-dlmm) to see if there was any plays or volume. I see a call from spiderman (one of my favorite callers).

### Choose your Bin Step and Base Fee

Here's the strategy I used with $TRUMP:

Initially, I went with TRUMP-USDC at a 1% fee and 100 bin because it had the highest TVL at first. That helped capture most of the trades.

When the price started to stabilize, I switched to TRUMP-USDC with a 0.1% fee and 50 bins to try and earn fees quickly.

1/8 A Degen’s Take on DLMM Strategies

Let’s talk degen strats. This isn’t your typical 20-bin or stablecoin farming strategy—it’s high risk, high reward, and demands hour-by-hour monitoring. ⚠️

The reward? Potentially massive profits, far beyond the safe stablecoin strategies. https://t.co/mNNNgHJbrj
