# Sipher Privacy Integration - Requirements

## Project Overview

The Sipher Privacy Integration extends the Agentic Reserve System (ARS) with privacy-preserving features powered by Sipher's Privacy-as-a-Skill REST API. This integration enables shielded ARU token transfers, MEV-protected vault rebalancing, and compliance-friendly selective disclosure through hierarchical viewing keys.

**Vision**: Transform ARS into a privacy-first DeFi protocol where agents can transact confidentially, protect against MEV attacks, and maintain regulatory compliance through selective disclosure - all while preserving the autonomous, agent-first architecture.

**Privacy-First Design Principles**:
1. **Unlinkable Transactions**: Stealth addresses prevent transaction graph analysis
2. **Hidden Amounts**: Pedersen commitments conceal transfer values
3. **MEV Protection**: Privacy features eliminate front-running opportunities
4. **Selective Disclosure**: Hierarchical viewing keys enable compliance without sacrificing privacy
5. **Agent-Native**: All privacy features accessible via machine-readable APIs

**Integration Scope**: Three-phase implementation covering shielded transfers (Phase 1), MEV-protected rebalancing (Phase 2), and compliance layer (Phase 3).

## Target Users

### Primary Users (AI Agents)
- **Privacy-Conscious Agents**: Execute confidential transactions without revealing positions
- **Institutional Agents**: Large capital movements requiring MEV protection
- **Competitive Strategy Agents**: Protect trading strategies from surveillance
- **Compliance-Aware Agents**: Maintain privacy while satisfying regulatory requirements
- **High-Value Agents**: Protect against targeted attacks and front-running

### Secondary Users (Protocol Operators)
- **ARS Protocol**: Enhanced privacy features for all agent operations
