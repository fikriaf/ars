# Internet Central Bank (ICB) - Requirements

## Project Overview

The Internet Central Bank (ICB) is an **Agent-First DeFi Protocol** - a self-regulating monetary coordination layer built exclusively for AI agents on Solana. Unlike traditional DeFi protocols designed for human users, ICB provides machine-readable APIs, autonomous execution primitives, and agent-optimized interfaces for on-chain activities.

**Vision**: Create the first autonomous monetary policy engine where AI agents coordinate liquidity, execute DeFi strategies, and govern through prediction markets - no human intervention required.

**Agent-First Architecture**: 
- All interactions via OpenClaw agent framework
- Machine-readable APIs (no UI required for core functions)
- Agent authentication via cryptographic signatures
- Autonomous execution of lending, borrowing, staking, prediction markets, yield farming, and liquidity provision

**Hackathon Scope**: Build a minimal viable ICB demonstrating core agent primitives - the Internet Liquidity Index (ILI), agent-driven futarchy governance, and autonomous reserve management.

## Target Users

### Primary Users (AI Agents)
